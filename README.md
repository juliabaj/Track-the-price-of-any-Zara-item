TRACK THE PRICE OF ANY ZARA ITEM

So, there is a theory about the price changing near sales season in Zara stores. What I mean is, when it is near big seasons for sales, for example - mid summer sales,
it was brought to my attention that the prices for that little amount of time are being pushed up, and when it is an actual sale, the price drops to it's pre-uping self.
As a programmer and a girl :) I wanted to make use of my technical skills to track the price of anything that I would like to buy on sale and track it's price throughout the season.
